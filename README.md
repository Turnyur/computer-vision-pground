# Computer Vision

This repository serves as a hands-on playground, where I implemented various computer vision techniques covered in my CV course at FAU, Germany. The lecture is based on Richard Szeliski's book: **"Computer Vision: Algorithms and Applications"** and **"Multiple View Geometry in Computer Vision"** by Richard Hartley and Andrew Zisserman. Here I look into fundamental and advanced topics of computer vision.

## Overview

The exercises cuts across wide range of computer vision tasks, where I focus on both theory and practice. The goal of this repository is to:

- **Solidify theoretical concepts** by coding them from scratch.
- **Experiment with my personal images**.
- **Explore advanced algorithms and techniques** used in modern computer vision pipelines.

## Topics Covered

### Image Processing and Feature Detection

- Use of **OpenCV** for image manipulation and processing.
- **Gaussian Filtering**, **Edge Detection** using Canny, and **Image Thresholding**.
- **Feature Detection** using techniques such as **Harris Corners**, and **Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF (ORB)**.
- **Feature Extraction** for identifying key points in images.

### Panorama Stitching

- Techniques for combining multiple overlapping images into a seamless panorama.
- **Feature Matching** and **Descriptor-Outlier Removal** using algorithms like SIFT and ORB.
- **Homography estimation** with **RANSAC** for aligning images.

### Structure from Motion (SfM)

- Reconstruction of 3D structures from 2D image sequences.
- **Identification of Inliers**: Leveraging the **epipolar geometry** and **distance from the epipolar line**.
- Application of the **8-Point Algorithm** for computing the **Fundamental Matrix**.
- **Triangulation** to recover the 3D position of matched key points from two or more views.

### Camera Models and Essential Matrix

- Decomposing the **Essential Matrix** to retrieve the camera's rotation and translation.
- Working with camera calibration techniques and **Projection Matrices**.

### Optical Flow and Image Alignment

- Implementation of **Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow** for tracking motion in video sequences.
- **Iterative solvers** to improve motion estimation between frames.
- Use of **Bilinear Interpolation** for sub-pixel accuracy in optical flow calculations.

### Stereo Vision and Disparity Maps

- Calculation of **Disparity Maps** for depth estimation from stereo images.
- Techniques for estimating the **maximum translation** between stereo pairs.
- **Rendering disparity hypotheses** by comparing pixel shifts between left and right stereo images.
- Application of **3D filtering** and post-processing techniques to enhance disparity maps and ensure local coherence.

## Jupyter Notebooks

In addition to the main implementation files in `src`, `utils`, and `resource`, I have also created **Jupyter notebooks** as a scratchpad for experimenting with various algorithms and concepts from the lectures. These notebooks serve as an interactive way to:

- Test out different methods.
- Visualize outputs and intermediary results.
- Debug and refine implementations.

While the notebooks are primarily for experimenting and trying out ideas with my own custom images, the main exercise implementations are structured in the organized directories:

- **src**: Core implementations of the algorithms.
- **utils**: Helper functions for processing images and computations.
- **resource**: Contains datasets and images used in the exercises.

By visualizing and comparing results in the notebooks, Iâ€™ve been able to gain valuable insights into the effectiveness of these techniques, which has been crucial for understanding lots of computer vision algorithms.

### Notable Implementations:

- **Feature detection** and matching to align and stitch images into panoramas.
- **Homography estimation** with outlier rejection using RANSAC for robust alignment.
- **Structure from Motion** with triangulation and camera pose recovery to reconstruct 3D scenes.
- **Optical Flow** for tracking motion in sequences of images.
- **Disparity Map Computation** for extracting depth information from stereo image pairs.
